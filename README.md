# CodeCut
CodeCut is a Google Chrome extension for the ease of the upcoming young achievers in Field of Computer Science. It displays a list of popular websites filtered on the basis of different categories like Competitive Programming, Development etc. so that a person can quickly reach out to websites related to the fields they are interested in.
It also helps to quickly save the URL of a webpage, so that we can access them anytime later. This is a useful option to make a note of important webpages and read it later when we want to schedule a glance. The default bookmarking options in Google Chrome allows you to add, delete, import and export the URLs. However, we can use this extension to save tabs and get all the information at one place like the sites we want to visitfrequently based on our interest and the tabs we saved to view later. One can apply the CodeCut Chrome extension to get the job done quite easily.


Chrome Extension : 
Our Project consists of a Chrome Extension which helps users to keep a track of the websites they want to glance through more frequently and also gives the user a gist of the field of computer science streams like computer programming resources, open source materials,etc. Extension is basically designed for a CSE enthusiast but is extendible to other users as well because it is customizable and we can add the tabs we want more often.
    

Advantages:
- Allows us to walkthrough our favourite websites anytime.
- We can customize the set of websites we want anytime.
- Also gets the user the domain of resources if he/she wants to do study or explore our given categories.
